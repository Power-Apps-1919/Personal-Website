        <h1>👋 About Me</h1>
        <p>👋 Hello! I'm <strong>Ippili Hemanth Sai Manikanta</strong>, a passionate Data Engineer with a knack for automation and cloud solutions. With over <strong>1.5 years</strong> of experience, I've honed my skills in designing and optimizing data workflows, automating processes, and improving operational efficiency.</p>
        <p>🚀 My journey in the tech world began with a strong foundation in Electronics and Communication Engineering, which I pursued at Chaitanya Bharathi Institute of Technology. Over the years, I've developed a deep understanding of various technologies, including <strong>Power Apps</strong>, <strong>Power Automate</strong>, <strong>Python</strong>, <strong>SQL</strong>, and <strong>Azure Function Apps</strong>.</p>
        <p>🏢 I've had the privilege of working at Accordion India (formerly Merilytics), where I've contributed to significant projects that have streamlined complex workflows, achieved substantial time savings, and enhanced data reliability. My dedication and hard work have earned me <strong>one promotion</strong> within a short span, and I continue to strive for excellence in every project I undertake.</p>
        <p>🌟 When I'm not immersed in data and automation, I enjoy exploring new technologies, contributing to open-source projects, and sharing my knowledge with the tech community. I'm always eager to learn and grow, and I'm excited about the endless possibilities that the world of data and automation holds.</p>
        <p>🙏 Thank you for visiting my portfolio! Feel free to explore my projects, view my resume, or get in touch with me through the contact page.</p>
        <p>💡 Fun Fact: I once built a chatbot that could tell jokes. It wasn't very funny, but it tried its best! 🤖😂</p>
